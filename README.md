# Model for predicting delays of the flight

This is a code base for final project of Erdos Institute's boot camp.

# Raw data

Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes of

(1) Safair airline on El Paso International Airport from 2019 to 2021.
(2) Safair airline on George Bush International Airport from 2019 to 2021.
(3) Delta airline on El Paso International Airport from 2019 to 2021.
(4) Delta airline on George Bush International Airport from 2019 to 2021.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory_data_Analysis.ipynb provides a basic statistics, histograms, and scatter plots for understanding data.

# Modeling for flight delay

Based on three variables,

(1) Destination
(2) Schduled departure time
(3) The day of the week,

We estimate whether flight delays more than 15 minutes or not using Logistic regressions.  All the variables are hot coded. Logistic_regression.ipynb provides the model and its score on the given data.
